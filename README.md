## Closure in Javascript

### Question 1: What is Closure in Javascript?

[MDN definition](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Closures):
Closures are functions that refer to independent (free) variables (variables that are used locally, but defined in an enclosing scope). In other words, these functions 'remember' the environment in which they were created.

[Javascript.isSexy](http://javascriptissexy.com/understand-javascript-closures-with-ease/): A closure is an function that has access to the outer (enclosing) functionâ€™s variables-scope chain.


### Question 2: What will output the following code and why:

```
function outerFunction() {
    var flag = undefined;

    function innerFunction() {
      if (true) {
        flag = true;
      } else {
        var flag = false;
      }

      console.log(flag);
    }

    innerFunction();
}

outerFunction();
```

**Answer**
It will be output `true`

### Question 3: Resolving example of problem code

What will output these example? 

```
for (var i=0; i < 10; i++){
    setTimeout(function(){
        console.log(i);
    }, 1000);
}
```

How to fix it to output numbers from 0 to 9?

**Answer**

Ther're several ways to resolve code above.

1) By passing variable into wrapper-function
```
for (var i=0; i < 10; i++){
    setTimeout((function(param){
        console.log(i);
    })(i), 1000);
}
```

2) By using ES6 feature, by using [let syntax](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/let) particularly:
```
for (let i=0; i < 10; i++){
    setTimeout(function(){
        console.log(i);
    }, 1000);
}
```

3) By [binding](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/bind) `console.log` function: 
```
for (var i=0; i < 10; i++){
    setTimeout(console.log.bind(console, i), 1000);
}
```
